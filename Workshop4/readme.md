## Workshop 4 - Supervised Machine Learning

This workshop covers an introduction to supervised machine learning. This is slightly different to the previous workshops in that we are expecting you to apply an existing set of code to new data.

In this example - I show you how to set up and apply a random forest regressor to some data, and the task for the workshop is to take a similar dataset and try and fit a regressor to Nanoparticle dataset we have been working with previously.
