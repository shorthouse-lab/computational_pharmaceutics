    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "A pharmaceutical company is developing a new tablet formulation for a pain-relief medication. The goal is to analyze different formulations with varying ingredient compositions and determine how they affect dissolution rate, stability, and bioavailability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each formulation consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Active Ingredient (%)__: The proportion of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in the tablet.\n",
    "- __Filler (%)__: The proportion of excipients (e.g., lactose, cellulose) used as fillers.\n",
    "- __Binder (%)__: The proportion of binders (e.g., PVP, starch) to help tablet cohesion.\n",
    "- __Disintegrant (%)__: The proportion of disintegrants (e.g., croscarmellose) to help tablet dissolution.\n",
    "- __Lubricant (%)__: The proportion of lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate) to aid manufacturing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You also realise you can bin the Active Ingredient into three categories (__API_group__) - Low (<= 15%), Medium (> 15% and <= 30%), and High (> 30%)\n",
    "\n",
    "The company is tracking __key formulation outcomes__:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __DissolutionRate (% dissolved in 30 min)__ – Higher values indicate faster drug release.\n",
    "- __Stability (% remaining after 6 months at 40°C/75%RH)__ – Higher values indicate better stability.\n",
    "- __Bioavailability (AUC in plasma, normalized to 100)__ – Measures drug absorption efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is available in an excel file called \"drug_formulation_data.xlsx\" which is available in the github repository."
