## Workshop 6 - Cheminformatics

In this workshop we demonstrate how to apply machine learning models to molecules. We will cover two ways to convert molecules to be "machine readable". 

We will also cover applying both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to these descriptors.

I have also provided an answer notebook for this workshop.
