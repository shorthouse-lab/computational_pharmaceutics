# Workshop 3 - Unsupervised Machine Learning

This is the folder for the third workshop on PHAY0076 - covering unsupervised machine learning.

This workshop can be run in two ways:

- Download and run the notebooks on your own computer/laptop (which will require installing UMAP - the code to do so is in the notebook).
- Run the notebook using google colab: https://colab.research.google.com in which case I have preloaded the dataset as a dictionary.
